This repository contains the dataset and code for **X-AIGD**, a fine-grained benchmark designed for **eXplainable AI-Generated image Detection**. X-AIGD provides pixel-level human annotations of perceptual artifacts in AI-generated images, spanning low-level distortions, high-level semantics, and cognitive-level counterfactuals, aiming to advance robust and explainable AI-generated image detection methods. 


## 🎨 Artifact Taxonomy

We define a comprehensive artifact taxonomy comprising 3 levels and 7 specific categories to capture the diverse range of perceptual artifacts in AI-generated images.

</p>

*   **Low-level Distortions**: Fundamental visual irregularities, e.g., edge misalignments, unnatural textures.
*   **High-level Semantics**: Abnormal object structures and semantic inconsistencies.
*   **Cognitive-level Counterfactuals**: Violations of commonsense or physical laws.


## 🚀 Key Features

*   **Pixel-level Grounding**: Provides 18,000+ artifact instances across 3,000+ annotated samples with categorization and polygon mask localization.
*   **Diverse Generators**: Collects 52,000 fake images from 13 text-to-image models, which covers:
    * Different architectures: diffusion UNets, diffusion Transformers, auto-regressive models
    * Popular, up-to-date models: e.g., SD 3.5, FLUX.1-dev, and PixArt-α
    * Community fine-tuned models focusing on realism (from [Civitai](https://civitai.com/)): e.g., [SD3.5L-iPhonePhoto](https://civitai.com/models/738556?modelVersionId=987578)
*   **Semantic Alignment**: Features paired real and fake images with consistent semantics for unbiased interpretability assessment.
*   **Multi-level Analysis**: Enables systematic evaluation of model reliance on human-interpretable cues vs. opaque statistical features.


## 🔍 Dataset Viewer

We provide a lightweight interactive Streamlit app for exploring X-AIGD images, artifact categories, polygon annotations, and sample metadata. The viewer supports:

- Browse samples image by image with artifact overlay visualization
- Filter by artifact category and switch between data splits
- Keyboard shortcuts for efficient navigation and filtering
- Jump to specific samples by generator and UID

For setup and usage instructions, see [tools/dataset_viewer/README.md](tools/dataset_viewer/README.md).


## 📅 Current Status & TODO

We are currently preparing the dataset and code for public release. Stay tuned!

- **X-AIGD dataset**: Pixel-level annotated subset and full image collection.
  - All images and artifact annotations have been released on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Coxy7/X-AIGD)
- **Dataset-related scripts**: Scripts for dataset processing, metric calculation, etc.
  - Dataset viewer released: [tools/dataset_viewer](tools/dataset_viewer)
  - [WIP] Metric calculation code
- **Experiment code**: Code for model training and evaluation. (TODO)
